      <p>
        if you are a serious book reader or if reading is an activity you are
        planning to take on, you canâ€™t start reading books randomly without
        following some sort of structure or strategy that includes a reading
        list or a book list. If you want to take your book reading to the next
        level, then you have to know how to organize books using a reading list.
